# TypeHero

## About Us

TypeScript's typing system can be very powerful when used correctly. The problem
is that most developers or engineers don't use much more than they have to in
their day to day. Inevitably a moment comes where their knowledge just doesn't
cut it for a use case, and they have to reach out to a community for help. We
aim to be not only the community but the platform they can use to learn more of
the intricacies of TypeScript's typing system.

## Quick Start
