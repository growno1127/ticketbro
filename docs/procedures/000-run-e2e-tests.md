Date: 2023-10-17

Status: accepted

# Context

TypeHero utilizes Playwright for E2E testing. Playwrite enables reliable, end-to-end
tesing for modern web apps. Here is a [link to their docs](https://playwright.dev/docs/intro).

# Decision

If you would like to write a test, please follow the steps below:

1. Navigate to the folder `apps/web/tests/e2e`
2. Create a new file with the name of your test. For example, `my-test.test.ts`.
3. To run the test, run the following command `npx playwright test`.

Tests output will be displayed in the terminal by default, to enable UI mode, where you can see a visual output,
refer to
[these docs](https://playwright.dev/docs/test-ui-mode).

# Consequences

This decision will allow us to have a reliable test suite that will ensure that our app is working as expected.
